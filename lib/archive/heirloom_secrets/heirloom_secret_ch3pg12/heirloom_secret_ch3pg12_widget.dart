Mrs. Harper spoke to you about me?\" Kirsty started, attempting to sound friendly and conciliatory.\n\nHe stood up, wiping his hands on a rag, his posture stiff and defensive. \"Yeah, she called. Said you\'re Jonathan\'s daughter. That doesn\'t change things here.\"\n\nKirsty\'s attempt at a charming approach faltered under his unwelcoming gaze. \"I just want to talk. Maybe we can figure this out, find some common ground?\"\n\nRyan\'s expression hardened slightly. \"Look, I know you might be who you say you are, but that doesn’t automatically give you rights to this house. I’ve made a life here.\"\n\nFeeling a mix of humiliation and frustration, Kirsty struggled to maintain her composure. She had hoped for some semblance of amiability, but his continued hostility was a clear reminder of the complexity of the situation.\n\n\"I understand that,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside. \"But surely there’s a way we can resolve this without hostility.\"\n\nRyan leaned against the porch railing, his gaze steady. \"This isn’t just about a house, Miss Thomas. It’s about a life, a commitment. You can’t just walk in and expect everything to fall into place because of a piece of paper.\"\n\nKirsty felt the sting of his words, the implication that she was an outsider trying to reclaim something she had abandoned. The conversation was far from the amicable discussion she had hoped for, leaving her to wonder how she could possibly bridge the gap between them.',
