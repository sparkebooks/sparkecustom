The revelation of the conflicting wills and Ryan\'s former career as an attorney added layers of complexity to an already tangled situation. She needed guidance, a plan, but most of all, she needed to understand the truth about her father\'s intentions.\n\nAs she strolled through the quaint streets of the town, her thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the local library. A beacon of calm and familiarity, it was a place where she had spent countless hours as a child. Perhaps, she thought, it might offer some solace now, a quiet place to gather her thoughts.\n\nInside, the library was as she remembered it: rows of books, the gentle hush of a sacred space of learning, and the faint smell of aged paper. She found a secluded corner and sat down, letting the silence envelop her. Here, in this haven of tranquility, Kirsty allowed herself to think clearly.\n\nFirst, she needed legal advice - she sent a hasty email to her lawyer in New York, along with the wills she had, and asked for a local lawyer to speak with. Then, she had to delve deeper into her father\'s life in the years she was away. Understanding his relationship with Ryan could be key to unraveling the mystery of the dual wills.\n\nBut beyond the legal battle and the quest for truth, Kirsty felt a deeper struggle within her. This was not just about a house or an inheritance; it was about reconnecting with a past she had left behind, about facing the pain of her father\'s perceived abandonment, and about understanding the man he had become in her absence.\n\nResolved to take the first steps, Kirsty left the library with a newfound sense of purpose.
