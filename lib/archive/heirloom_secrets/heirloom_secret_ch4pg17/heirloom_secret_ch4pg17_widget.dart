The building, with its stately architecture and the air of quiet bureaucracy, felt like a stepping stone into the unknown chapters of her father\'s life.\n\nAt the town hall, she requested property records and any documentation related to her fatherâ€™s estate. While waiting, her mind wandered, piecing together the scattered memories of her father, the house, and her childhood.\n\nThe clerk returned, handing her a folder of documents. Kirsty\'s heart raced as she flipped through them. There was the original deed, a few routine transactions, but nothing that directly addressed the conflicting wills. She needed more, something personal, something that revealed the nature of her father\'s relationship with Ryan.\n\nLeaving the town hall, Kirsty decided her next step was to speak with some of the town\'s long-standing residents who might have known her father. As she walked down the main street, contemplating her approach, she spotted Ryan outside his grocery store, unloading supplies from a truck.\n\nDetermined to confront the situation head-on, Kirsty approached him. \"Ryan, we need to talk,\" she said, her voice steady.\n\nRyan looked up, his expression guarded. \"What is it now, Kirsty?\"\n\n\"I\'ve been going through public records, trying to understand what happened. But I need to know more about you and my father. How did you two meet? What was your relationship like?\"\n\nRyan hesitated, then set down the box he was carrying. \"I don\'t see how that\'s any of your business.\"',
